        <h2>This was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner and the original location was at Singapore River in Merlion Park. Then of that it was recolocated 120 away from the original place, also inside the park. During the maintenance of the original statue the visitors made a lot of illustrations, the Merlion was still there to see, but it was covered at the sides simulating a shower and was also accompanied by a speech bubble that said: "EXCUSE ME while I take a shower..." On 2009 the Merlion in the Merlion Park was struck by a lightning, after that an image of the fragments of the head on the ground was published.</h2><br>
        <h3><ol>

        <h1><ul><em><strong>Esplanade</strong></em></ul></h1>
        <img src="images\The_Esplanade_–_Theatres_on_the_Bay.jpg" alt="monument">
        <h1>Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay (also known as the Esplanade Theatres (Malay: Teater di Persisiran) or simply The Esplanade) is a statutory board under the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) and a performing arts centre located in the Downtown Core of Singapore near the mouth of the Singapore River. Named after the nearby Esplanade Park, it consists of a concert hall which seats about 1,600 and a theatre with a capacity of about 2,000 for the performing arts.</h1><br>
        <h2>The original design, presented to the public in 1994, consisted of unadorned glass cases over the theatres, and initially elicited criticisms from the public, including calling it "two copulating aardvarks". Critics also accused that the design is insensitive to Singapore's location and climate as it would have created a greenhouse in the tropical climate of Singapore, but according to DPA director Vikas Gore some form of shading was always intended, and a cladding of aluminium sunshades was added to the final design. The unique architectural design has been said to have an appearance similar to either a durian (a tropical fruit) or the eyes of a fly. Hence, the building is colloquially known to locals as "the big durians".</h2><br>
