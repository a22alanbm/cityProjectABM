    <h3>Internationally recognized for his breakout role as Jasper Hale in The Twilight Saga (2008-2012) Jackson Rathbone was born to American parents living in the Republic of Singapore.

After graduating high school from the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting and music.

        As an actor, Jackson has appeared in over twenty motion pictures, including two international franchises, and appeared in multiple television shows as leads, guest stars, and in recurring roles.
        
        Jackson has produced several indie films (such as Gotham award winning "Girlfriend"), as well as Warner Brothers backed webseries ("Aim High"). In 2015, Jackson wrote, directed, and starred in the webseries Couch Surfing, USA (Marseille Web Fest official selection, Vancouver Web Fest WINNER Best Comedy).
